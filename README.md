# MicroPython font handling

This is an attempt to offer a standard method of creating and deploying fonts
to MicroPython display drivers.

# Introduction

MicroPython platforms generally have limited RAM, but more abundant storage in
the form of flash memory. Font files tend to be relatively large. The
conventional technique of rendering strings to a device involves loading the
entire font into RAM. This is fast but RAM intensive. The alternative of storing
the font as a random access file and loading individual characters into RAM on
demand is too slow for reasonable performance on most display devices.

This alternative implements a font as a Python source file, with the data being
declared as ``bytes`` objects. Such a file may be frozen as bytecode. On import
very little RAM is used, yet the data may be accessed fast. Note that the use
of frozen bytecode is entirely optional: font files may be imported in the
normal way if RAM usage is not an issue.

It is intended that the resultant file be usable with two varieties of display
devices and drivers. These comprise:

 1. Drivers using ``bytearray`` instances as frame buffers, including the
 official ``framebuffer`` class.
 2. Drivers for displays where the frame buffer is implemented in the display
 device hardware.

# The proposed solution

This consists of three components:

 1. font_to_py.py This is a utility intended to be run on a PC and converts a
 font file to Python source. See below.
 2. The Writer class (writer.py) This facilitates writing text to a device
 given a suitably designed device driver. See [here](./DRIVERS.md).
 3. A device driver specification. This includes an example for rendering text
 to an SSD1306 device with arbitrary fonts. Also described in the above reference.

# font_to_py.py

This is a command line utility written in Python 3 to be run on a PC. It takes
as input a font file in ``ttf`` or ``otf`` form together with a height in pixels
and outputs a Python source file containing the font data. Fixed and variable
pitch rendering are supported. The design has the following aims:

 * Independence of specific display hardware.
 * The path from font file to Python code to be fully open source.

The first is achieved by supplying hardware specific arguments to the utility.
These define horizontal or vertical mapping and the bit order for font data.

The second is achieved by using Freetype and the Freetype Python bindings. Its
use is documented [here](./FONT_TO_PY.md). This also details measurements of
RAM usage when importing fonts stored as frozen bytecode.

# Limitations

By default the ASCII character set from ``chr(32)`` to ``chr(126)`` is supported
but command line arguments enable the range to be modified with extended ASCII
characters to ``chr(255)`` being included if required. Kerning is not supported.
Fonts are one bit per pixel. This does not rule out colour displays: the device
driver can add colour information at the rendering stage. It does assume that
all pixels of a character are rendered identically.

Converting font files programmatically works best for larger fonts. For small
fonts, like the 8*8 default used by the SSD1306 driver, it is best to use
hand-designed binary font files: these are optimised for rendering at a specific
size.

# Font file interface

A font file is imported in the usual way e.g. ``import font14``. It contains
the following methods which return values defined by the arguments which were
provided to font-to-py:

``height`` Returns height in pixels.  
``max_width`` Returns maximum width of a glyph in pixels.  
``hmap`` Returns ``True`` if font is horizontally mapped. Should return ``True``  
``reverse`` Returns ``True`` if bit reversal was specified. Should return ``False``  
``monospaced`` Returns ``True`` if monospaced rendering was specified.  

Glyphs are returned with the ``get_ch`` method. Its argument is a character
and it returns the following values:

 * A ``memoryview`` object containing the glyph bytes.
 * The height in pixels.
 * The character width in pixels.

# An alternative solution

Brian Cappello has produced [this fork](https://github.com/briancappello/micropython-font-to-py.git).
This has an enhanced `font_to_py.py` program offering a fast line mapping along
with some clever optimisations designed to reduce font file size. He also has
an enhanced Writer class of interest to anyone producing a driver for display
hardware.

His `font_to_py.py` solution has not been implemented here because the font
files are incompatible with existing device drivers and GUI projects. Its use
should be considered for new projects.
